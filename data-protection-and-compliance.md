# Data protection and privacy

## Location of customer data

All customer data is stored in Europe, US or Australia depending on the customer's primary location. No storage data is transferred between Europe and US locations.

| Customer location    | Data storage location    |
|-------------|---------------|
| Europe | Ireland and Netherland |
| US | Virginia and California |
| Australia | Victoria and 	New South Wales |

## Retention policies

Medius store customer data as long as the customer is using MediusFlow. If the customer will no longer use MediusFlow all customer data will be removed from MediusFlow cloud. Before data is removed the data can be exported to the customer using a format agreed between the customer and Medius.

## Customer data and 3rd parties
Medius will not disclose customer data to a third party (including law enforcement, other government entity or civil litigant) except by request from customer or required by law. Should a third party contact us with a demand for customer data, we will attempt to redirect the third party to request it directly from the customer. As part of that, we may provide your basic contact information to the third party. If compelled to disclose customer data to a third party, we will promptly notify the customer and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so.

## Medius employee access to customer data 

Only Medius personnel required to access customer data to execute agreed activities may do so. In practice this means that all production data credentials are per default only available to Cloud Operations Team.

Restriced access is enforcedby the following guidelines for credentials related to customer data:

- Shared credentials are stored in systems allowing restricted access based on roles or individuals.
- Credentials are generated with at least 12 characters (including numbers and special characters).
- 2 factor authentication and periodically passwords updates are used where applicable.
- User accounts and credentials are reviewed quarterly.
