# Data protection and privacy

## Separation of customer data

Customer data is separated in unique SQL databases for each customer.

## Location of customer data

All customer data is stored in Europe or US depending on the customer's primary location. No storage data is transferred between Europe and US locations.

| Customer location    | Data storage location    |
|-------------|---------------|
| Europe | Ireland and Netherland |
| US | Virginia and California |

## Retention policies

Medius store customer data as long as the customer is using MediusFlow. If the customer will no longer use MediusFlow all customer data will be removed from MediusFlow cloud. Before data is removed the data can be exported to the customer using a format agreed between the customer and Medius.

## Customer data and 3rd parties
Medius will not disclose customer data to a third party (including law enforcement, other government entity or civil litigant) except by request from customer or required by law. Should a third party contact us with a demand for customer data, we will attempt to redirect the third party to request it directly from the customer. As part of that, we may provide your basic contact information to the third party. If compelled to disclose customer data to a third party, we will promptly notify the customer and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so.

## Medius employee access to customer data 

Only Medius personnel required to access customer data to execute agreed activities may do so. In practice this means that all production data credentials are per default only available to Cloud Operations Team. Due to requirements from implementation projects additional consultants may get similar permissions but only for individual customers.

Restriced access is enforcedby the following guidelines for credentials related to customer data:

- Shared credentials are stored in systems allowing restricted access based on roles or individuals.
- Credentials are generated with at least 12 characters (including numbers and special characters).
- 2 factor authentication and periodically passwords updates are used where applicable.
- User accounts and credentials are reviewed quarterly.

Process for on-boarding new employees:

- Employee participate in introduction to cloud environments.
- Employee's individual credentials are granted access to cloud tools and application by Cloud Operations Manager.
- Employee is granted access to shared credentials by Cloud Operations Manager.

Process for terminating employee accounts:

- Process for termination of employee accounts is initiated by Cloud Operations Manager or Human Resources.
- Individual credentials are revoked.
- Access to shared credentials are also revoked.
